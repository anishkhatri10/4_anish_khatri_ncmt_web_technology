Group B: Long Questions

    5. Explain the client-server architecture of the web with a neat diagram.
    Answer=>
    Client–server architecture is a network model where clients (users’ devices) request services and servers provide those services.
     -The client uses a web browser (Chrome, Edge) to request a web page.
     -The request is sent using HTTP/HTTPS.
     -The web server processes the request and sends the response (HTML, CSS, images).
     -The client displays the web page.

    6. Describe the functions of the following Internet services: Email, FTP, and VoIP.
    Answer=>
    a) Email
        - Used to send and receive electronic messages.
        - Supports attachments like documents and images.
        - Uses protocols such as SMTP, POP3, and IMAP.
    b) FTP (File Transfer Protocol)
        - Used to upload and download files between computers.
        - Commonly used by web developers to upload websites.
        - Works on a client–server model.
    c) VoIP (Voice over Internet Protocol)
        - Enables voice calls over the Internet.
        - Converts voice into digital data packets.
        - Examples: Zoom, Skype, WhatsApp calls.

     7. ”The Internet is a network of networks.” Elaborate on this statement explaining how
        packet switching works.
        The Internet connects millions of smaller networks (home, office, ISP networks) worldwide, hence it is called a network of networks.
        Answer=>
            Packet Switching:
                - Data is divided into small units called packets.
                - Each packet travels independently through different routes.
                - Packets are reassembled at the destination.
                - If one route fails, packets use alternative paths.

            Advantages:
                - Efficient data transfer
                - Reliable communication
                - Better use of network resources

Group C: Scenario-Based Questions
8. A startup company wants to host a website that displays the same information to all visitors and requires very low maintenance costs. However, they are being advised to use a dynamic website. As a consultant, would you agree? Justify your answer.
Answer=>
     As a consultant, I would not agree with the advice to use a dynamic website.

     The startup company wants:
       - The same information for all visitors
       - Very low maintenance cost
       - A simple website to display basic information

    A static website is best in this situation because:
        - The content does not change for different users
        - It does not need a database
        - It does not require server-side programming
        - It is cheap to host
        - It is fast and secure

    A dynamic website is useful only when:
        - Content changes frequently
        - User login, forms, or dashboards are required
        - High interaction is needed

    Conclusion:
        Since the company needs low cost and same content for all users, a static website is the correct and better choice.

    
    9. A user types www.google.com into their browser, but the browser displays a ”Server Not
       Found” error, even though the internet connection is active. However, accessing the site
       via 142.250.190.46 works. Diagnose the problem and explain the underlying technology
       that failed.
       Answer=> 
            The problem occurred due to a DNS (Domain Name System) failure.
            Explanation:
               - When a user types www.google.com in the browser:
               - The browser asks the DNS server to convert the domain name into an IP address.
               - DNS should translate www.google.com into 142.250.190.46.
               - In this case, DNS could not resolve the domain name.
               - Therefore, the browser shows “Server Not Found”.

            However:
                - When the user enters the IP address directly, the website opens.
                - This means the server and internet connection are working fine.
            Underlying Technology Failed:
                - DNS (Domain Name System)

            Conclusion:
            The error happened because the DNS server was not working or misconfigured


    10. A multinational corporation wants to share sensitive inventory data with specific suppliers
    but does not want this information available to the general public. Explain which network
    type (Intranet, Extranet, or Internet) they should implement and why.
    Answer=>
        The company should use an Extranet.

        The company wants to:
            - Share sensitive inventory data
            - Allow access only to specific suppliers
            - Keep data private and secure

        Why Extranet?
            - An Intranet is only for company employees.
            - The Internet is public and not secure.
            - An Extranet allows limited and controlled access to external users.
            - Suppliers can access data using login credentials.
            - Data remains protected from the general public.

        Conclusion:
        An Extranet is the best network type because it securely shares information with selected external partners
