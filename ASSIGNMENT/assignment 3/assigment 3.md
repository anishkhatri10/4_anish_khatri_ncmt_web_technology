### Group-A: Short Questions

   ## 1.Define Information Architecture (IA).
        Ans=
            Information Architecture (IA) is the process of organizing, structuring, and labeling website content so that users can easily find information and navigate the website efficiently. It focuses on menus, categories, navigation, and content hierarchy.
    
   ## 2. What is a “Wireframe”?
        Ans= 
            A wireframe is a basic visual blueprint of a website that shows the layout of pages, placement of elements like menus, buttons, images, and content without design details such as colors or graphics. It helps designers plan structure before development.

  ## 3. Explain the concept of “Cognitive Friction” in web design.
        Ans=
            Cognitive friction refers to the mental effort users must spend to understand and use a website. Poor navigation, confusing layouts, unclear labels, and hidden menus increase cognitive friction and frustrate users.
    
  ## 4. Why should URL slugs use hyphens instead of underscores?
        Ans=
            Search engines treat hyphens (-) as word separators, while underscores (_) are treated as part of a word. Hyphens improve readability, usability, and SEO ranking.
            Example:
            web-design-basics
    


### Group B: Long Questions
  ## 5. Compare and contrast Hierarchical (Tree) structure and Linear (Sequential) structure. Give examples.
        Ans=
            A Hierarchical (Tree) structure organizes content in a parent–child relationship. The homepage acts as the root, with categories and subcategories branching out. It is ideal for large websites with many pages because it allows users to drill down step-by-step.
            Example:
            University Website
            Home → Faculties → Departments → Courses

            A Linear (Sequential) structure arranges content in a fixed order, where users move from one page to the next. It is simple and controlled, making it suitable for tutorials or step-by-step processes.
            Example:
            Online Exam 
            Page 1 → Page 2 → Page 3 → Submit

            Comparison Summary:
            Hierarchical: Flexible, scalable, good for complex sites
            Linear: Simple, controlled, best for guided tasks


## 6. Explain the “Three-Click Rule” and its significance in UX design.
        Ans=
            The Three-Click Rule states that users should be able to find any information on a website within three clicks from the homepage. If users need more clicks, they may feel frustrated and leave the site.

            This rule is important in UX design because:
                - It reduces user effort
                - Improves navigation efficiency
                - Increases user satisfaction
                - Lowers bounce rate

            Although not a strict rule, it emphasizes the need for clear menus, logical structure, and easy access to information.


## 7. “Plan before you do.” Explain how Card Sorting and Flowcharts help in planning a website’s structure.
        Ans=
            Planning is essential to avoid confusion and redesign later.

            Card Sorting helps designers understand how users logically group content. Users arrange topics into categories, which helps create intuitive menus and navigation.

            Flowcharts visually represent how users move through the website. They show page sequences, decision points, and user paths, ensuring smooth navigation.

            Together, these tools:
                - Improve usability
                - Reduce cognitive friction
                - Save time and cost
                - Create user-centered website structures



### Group C: Scenario-Based Questions

## 8. University Website Structure: Model, Diagram, and Justification

        Ans=
            For a University website with hundreds of pages, the Hierarchical (Tree) structure is the best choice.
             
                Reason for Choosing Hierarchical Structure:
                    - Handles large volumes of content efficiently
                    - Easy to scale as new departments or pages are added
                    - Matches users’ mental model (faculty → department → course)
                    - Improves navigation and SEO
            
            Diagram
             
                        Home
            ├── Admissions
            │    ├── Undergraduate
            │    ├── Postgraduate
            │    └── Scholarships
            ├── Academics
            │    ├── Faculties
            │    │     ├── Science
            │    │     ├── Management
            │    │     └── Arts
            ├── Departments
            │    ├── Computer Science
            │    ├── Business Studies
            ├── Alumni
            └── News & Events

            Justification:
                Students, parents, and faculty can quickly navigate through logical levels without confusion. This structure minimizes cognitive friction and supports long-term growth.



## 9. Navigation Hidden Behind Icon: KISS Principle Analysis
        Ans=
            The KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid) principle emphasizes simplicity and clarity in design.

            Design Failure Analysis:
                - Navigation hidden behind a small icon increases cognitive friction
                - Desktop users expect visible menus
                - Users waste time searching for basic navigation
                - Leads to frustration and quick exit (high bounce rate)
            
            Why This Violates KISS:
                - Over-minimalism sacrifices usability
                - Important elements should be obvious
                - Simplicity means easy to use, not hard to find
            Better Solution:
                - Display a clear navigation bar on desktop
                - Use icons only as secondary support
                - Maintain consistency across devices
            
            This failure shows that simple design must prioritize user expectations, not aesthetics alone.
    

  ## 10. Poor URL Structure: Problems and Improved Solution
        Ans=
            Problems with URL:
            www.shop.com/prod?id=55&cat=9

            For Users:
                - Hard to read and remember
                - No indication of product or category
                - Reduces trust and clarity

            For Search Engines (SEO):
                - Not keyword-friendly
                - Poor indexing
                - Lower ranking in search results
            
            Better URL Structure Using Page Slugs:
                www.shop.com/electronics/smartphones/samsung-galaxy-s23

            Advantages of Page Slugs:
                - Human-readable
                - SEO-optimized with keywords
                - Improves click-through rate
                - Easy to share and remember
            
            A clean URL structure enhances both user experience and search engine visibility.
